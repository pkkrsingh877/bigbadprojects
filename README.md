I want to host some of the static websites that I create on github.


## p1

In this project, I followed along with Code With Harry's YouTube Video and made a website. Then I made some changes to it and have posted the code here.

The following are the changes I have made.

1. Added Footer all by myself
2. In his project, hours, minutes and seconds were being displayed in single digits if they were in between 1 to 9. I made it so it displays 01, 02, 03,... and so on.
3. Changed a link in the navbar
4. Changed the names of dropdown menu content
5. Changed the website name


That's all....

Thanks for visiting...
